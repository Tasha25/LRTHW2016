## Some questions:



# Study Drills exercise 12
Problem: I am getting the wrong Answer
print "Give me some money:"
money = gets.chomp.to_f
print "10% of the money is #{money*0.10}"

Answer:  your script gives me back 10.34 in change
My answer: 10.340000000000002

#Study Drills Exercise 13
Problem, there is not gets.chomp in the code.
3. Change your script to use $stdin.gets.chomp everywhere that you have gets.chomp. You should use $stdin.gets.chomp from now on since the action gets.chomp has problems with ARGV.

4. Now that you are using $stdin.gets.chomp (see #3) you can add ARGV to your script to get something from the user. Don't over think this. Just use ARGV to get one thing, then $stdin.gets.chomp to get something else.
